Building the project
--------------------

To be able to build and use this project, you will need Eclipse APP4MC version 0.9.8.

1.  Download this repository or clone it.

2.  Open Eclipse APP4MC version 0.9.8, create a new workspace and add all the plugin project directories using **File**... **Open Project From File System**.

3.  Double click the MANIFEST.MF file in the **META-INF** folder of the ``org.eclipse.app4mc.visualization.timeline`` plugin project. Under the `Overview` tab, find the `Testing` section and click on the **Launch an Eclipse Application** link. A new Eclipse APP4MC instance is started.

4.  In the new APP4MC instance, open any APP4MC model project. A quick way to add a project might be using some of the APP4MC model examples bundled with Eclipse APP4MC, e.g the Democar example, using **File**... **New**... **Examples**... **APP4MC AMALTHEA Model Examples**.

5.  Double click the model file and the AMALTHEA Contents Tree window is opened. 

6.  In the AMALTHEA Contents Tree window, right click the AMALTHEA Model and select **Open APP4MC Visualization** in the popup menu. A visualization panel is opened under the contents tree and you can see the user interface to use to run the simulation and visualization.
