What is Eclipse APP4MC?
=======================

**Eclipse APP4MC** is a platform for engineering embedded multi- and many-core software systems. 
The platform enables the creation and management of complex tool chains including simulation and validation. 
As an open platform, proven in the automotive sector by Bosch and their partners, it supports interoperability 
and extensibility and unifies data exchange in cross-organizational projects. [1]_

   AMALTHEA Model for APP4MC

The goal of the APP4MC project is the development of a consistent, open, expandable tool platform for embedded software 
engineering. It is based on the model driven approach as basic engineering methodology. The main focus is the 
optimization of embedded multi-core systems. The result of the project is an open tool platform in different aspects. 
On the one hand it is published under the Eclipse Public License (EPL) and on the other hand it is open to be 
integrated with existing or new tools either on a company individual basis or with commercially available tools.
