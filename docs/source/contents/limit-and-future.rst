================================
Limitations and Future Extension
================================

This section will look at the current limitations of the project
mainly due to was what was achievable in the duration and scope
of the Google Summer of Code 2020 and possible future extensions 
to the project.

-----------
Limitations
-----------

The project for now only covers the simulation of tasks on models
with partitioned schedulers. Global schedulers are not supported. 
So APP4MC models using global schedulers will not work with this 
project and will just show a warning to the user and prevent any 
attempt at simulation.

-----------------
Future Extensions
-----------------
Possible future extensions considered for this project includes:
    -   Support for models with global schedulers.
    -   Possibility of moving the simulation engine to the cloud to 
        support simulation using web technologies.
